# semantic-refactor-2

Semantic refactor challenge to update current code with semantic HTML elements and create a more accessible page with attributes 

what was the motivation for this challenge? 

to learn how to read HTML, identify a more efficient structure and utilize better elements that describe what is occurring within the code. This challenge also involved debugging errors and incorrect tags that changed the overall page when it was not intended to. 

what problem did this solve? 

this challenge allowed me to address issues along the lines of having meaningful HTML code that is accessible to all people without actually changing the output. 

what did you learn? 

As a student who has never viewed HTML code, it was very hard to follow the original code with <div> tags. Reading different material and doing the activities within class helped me understand the flow of HTML and how to make the overall code easier to navigate.
